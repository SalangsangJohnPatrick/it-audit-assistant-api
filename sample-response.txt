        "recommendation": "1. Immediately change all default passwords to strong, unique passwords. 2. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all user accounts to add an extra layer of security. 3. Implement a password policy that enforces regular password changes and complexity requirements. 4. Conduct regular audits to ensure compliance with password and MFA policies.",

Default passwords may have been left unchanged for convenience, and MFA may have been disabled to simplify user access without considering the security implications.",

A timeline will be established to change all default passwords and enable MFA across all systems. Additionally, a review of current security policies will be conducted to ensure they are robust and enforced."
